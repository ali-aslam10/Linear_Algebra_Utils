# Linear Algebra

## Overview

Welcome to the Linear Algebra repository.LinearAlgebraUtils is a collection of standalone Python programs designed to perform various linear algebra operations. This repository includes programs for converting matrices to row echelon form (REF), reduced row echelon form (RREF), checking if a matrix is in RREF, and finding the inverse of a matrix using Gaussian elimination.
